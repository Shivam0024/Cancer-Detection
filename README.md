# Cancer-Detection
This dataset is designed for developing a machine learning model that classifies tumors as malignant (M) or benign (B) based on features derived from cell nucleus images. The key objective is to utilize these features to predict the diagnosis of a tumor, thereby aiding in early and accurate cancer detection.
